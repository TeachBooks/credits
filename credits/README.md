# Credits Module

This will eventually get turned into Sphinx extensions and/or modules in the teachbooks package. For now, it is a series of py and yml files in the MUDE book. An open source license will eventually be provided, but for now this should only be used elsewhere with explicit permission from Robert Lanzafame (create an Issue in this repository to help me track it and know where it is being used, so I can help update it later).

This was written with a bit of help from GitHub Copilot by creating the desired structure then asking it to "fill in the blanks."

Eventually the `_toc_credits.yml` will be part of our long-dreamed-for "table of contents on steroids."

Features to add:
- check for missing entries between `_toc.yml` and `_toc_credits.yml`
- itemize files for which each credit/source applies

`_credits.yml` has the following parts:
1. General settings, book level
  - blah
2. 

Make key unique

Keys for sources:
- type:
  - internal = distributed as part of MUDE book
  - external = from somewhere else
  - processed based on yet-to-be-determined metadata
